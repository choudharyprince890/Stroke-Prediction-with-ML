# Stroke Predition with Machine Learning

This project is build with flask and bootstrap framework powered by machine learning model trained on Random Forrest Algoritham with the 95.6% accuracy.



## Summary

- ML model is trained on data set from kaggle and before EDA and Feature Engineering is perfoemed on Dataset
- Machine Learning Pipeline is used in this project with transformers. 
- Pipeline contaions min-max scalar and Grid Search CV for Hyper parameter Tuning.
- Random Forrest Algoritham is also implementd inside the Pipeline.
